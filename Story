Harry was learning to swing a bat so that he could play baseball. Harry swung the bat but did not hit the ball.

“Missed,” he said.

“Watch the ball, Harry,” his dad called.

Harry tried again. Missed.

On game day, it was Harry’s turn to bat. Harry missed the ball. Harry missed the ball again.

The last time, Harry swung hard. His bat hit the ball. The ball flew through the air. Harry ran all the way around the bases.

Everyone cheered, “A homer for Harry!”
